# Universal ID Reader

A cross-platform application for reading and extracting data from credit card-sized identification documents including driver's licenses and passports from multiple countries.

## Project Overview

This application will run on iOS, Android, macOS, and Windows, providing real-time ID document scanning and data extraction capabilities with a focus on privacy and offline processing.

## Architecture

### Core Technology Stack
- **Computer Vision**: OpenCV for image preprocessing and document detection
- **OCR Engine**: Tesseract (open source) with cloud API fallback options
- **Machine Learning**: TensorFlow Lite for document classification and field detection
- **Cross-platform Framework**: Flutter with native plugins for camera and ML integration

### System Layers
1. **Image Capture & Preprocessing** - Camera integration and image enhancement
2. **Document Classification** - ML-based document type and country detection
3. **Data Extraction** - OCR processing with country-specific optimizations
4. **Data Validation & Parsing** - Field validation and confidence scoring
5. **Security & Privacy** - Local processing and data encryption

- [ ] Build document quality assessment (blur, lighting validation)
- [ ] Create image preprocessing pipeline
- [ ] Add rotation and orientation correction

### Phase 3: Document Classification
- [ ] Train ML model for document type detection (passport vs license vs ID)
- [ ] Implement country/region classification
- [ ] Create template matching system for known document formats
- [ ] Add confidence scoring for classifications
- [ ] Optimize models for mobile deployment

### Phase 4: OCR and Data Extraction
- [ ] Integrate Tesseract OCR with country-specific configurations
- [ ] Implement MRZ (Machine Readable Zone) parsing for passports
- [ ] Add barcode/QR code reading capabilities
- [ ] Create regex patterns for different ID formats per country
- [ ] Build field extraction and mapping system

### Phase 5: Data Processing and Validation
- [ ] Implement data validation rules (date formats, check digits, etc.)
- [ ] Add cross-reference validation between extracted fields
- [ ] Create confidence scoring system for extracted data
- [ ] Build data standardization and formatting
- [ ] Add error handling and fallback mechanisms

### Phase 6: Security and Privacy
- [ ] Implement local-only processing pipeline
- [ ] Add data encryption for temporary storage
- [ ] Create secure deletion mechanisms
- [ ] Implement privacy compliance features (GDPR, CCPA)
- [ ] Add audit logging for data processing

### Phase 7: User Interface and Experience
- [ ] Design intuitive camera interface with guidance
- [ ] Create real-time feedback system for image quality
- [ ] Build results display and editing interface
- [ ] Add settings and configuration options
- [ ] Implement accessibility features

### Phase 8: Platform Optimization
- [ ] Optimize performance for mobile devices
- [ ] Add platform-specific ML acceleration (Core ML for iOS, ML Kit for Android)
- [ ] Implement efficient memory management
- [ ] Add offline capability indicators
- [ ] Create platform-specific UI adaptations

### Phase 9: Testing and Validation
- [ ] Create comprehensive test suite with real document samples
- [ ] Test across different lighting conditions and angles
- [ ] Validate accuracy across multiple countries and document types
- [ ] Perform security and privacy testing
- [ ] Conduct user acceptance testing

### Phase 10: Deployment and Distribution
- [ ] Set up CI/CD pipeline for all platforms
- [ ] Create app store listings and compliance documentation
- [ ] Implement crash reporting and analytics
- [ ] Add update mechanisms
- [ ] Create documentation and support materials

## Target Countries (Initial Release)
- [ ] United States (Driver's License, Passport)
- [ ] Canada (Driver's License, Passport)
- [ ] United Kingdom (Driver's License, Passport)
- [ ] European Union (ID Cards, Passports)
- [ ] Australia (Driver's License, Passport)

## Technical Requirements

### Development Environment
- Flutter SDK 3.0+
- Xcode (for iOS/macOS development)
- Android Studio (for Android development)
- Visual Studio (for Windows development)
