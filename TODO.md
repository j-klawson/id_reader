# Universal ID Reader

A cross-platform C++ library for reading and extracting data from credit card-sized identification documents including driver's licenses and passports from multiple countries.

## Project Overview

This C++ library provides real-time ID document scanning and data extraction capabilities with a focus on privacy and offline processing. The library can be integrated into applications on iOS, Android, macOS, and Windows platforms.

## Architecture

### Core Technology Stack
- **Core Language**: C++17 with C API bindings
- **Computer Vision**: OpenCV for image preprocessing and document detection
- **OCR Engine**: Tesseract (open source) with cloud API fallback options
- **Machine Learning**: TensorFlow Lite for document classification and field detection
- **Build System**: CMake for cross-platform builds

### System Layers
1. **Image Preprocessing** - Image enhancement and document boundary detection
2. **Document Classification** - ML-based document type and country detection
3. **Data Extraction** - OCR processing with country-specific optimizations
4. **Data Validation & Parsing** - Field validation and confidence scoring
5. **C API Layer** - Simple C interface for cross-platform integration

- [ ] Add barcode/QR code reading capabilities
- [ ] Create regex patterns for different ID formats per country
- [ ] Build field extraction and mapping system

### Phase 5: Data Processing and Validation
- [ ] Implement data validation rules (date formats, check digits, etc.)
- [ ] Add cross-reference validation between extracted fields
- [ ] Create confidence scoring system for extracted data
- [ ] Build data standardization and formatting
- [ ] Add error handling and fallback mechanisms

### Phase 6: Security and Privacy
- [ ] Implement local-only processing pipeline
- [ ] Add data encryption for temporary storage
- [ ] Create secure deletion mechanisms
- [ ] Implement privacy compliance features (GDPR, CCPA)
- [ ] Add audit logging for data processing

### Phase 7: API Design and Integration
- [ ] Design comprehensive C API interface
- [ ] Create language bindings (Swift, Kotlin, C#, JavaScript)
- [ ] Build example applications for each platform
- [ ] Add configuration and settings management
- [ ] Implement callback-based processing for real-time feedback

### Phase 8: Platform Optimization
- [ ] Optimize performance for target platforms
- [ ] Add platform-specific ML acceleration (Core ML for macOS/iOS, DirectML for Windows, NNAPI for Android)
- [ ] Implement efficient memory management
- [ ] Add GPU acceleration support (OpenCL/CUDA)
- [ ] Create platform-specific build optimizations

### Phase 9: Testing and Validation
- [ ] Create comprehensive test suite with real document samples
- [ ] Test across different lighting conditions and angles
- [ ] Validate accuracy across multiple countries and document types
- [ ] Perform security and privacy testing
- [ ] Conduct user acceptance testing

### Phase 10: Deployment and Distribution
- [ ] Set up CI/CD pipeline for all platforms
- [ ] Create library packaging for distribution (CMake, pkg-config, vcpkg, CocoaPods)
- [ ] Implement crash reporting and analytics
- [ ] Add library versioning and ABI stability
- [ ] Create comprehensive documentation and API reference

## Target Countries (Initial Release)
- [ ] United States (Driver's License, Passport)
- [ ] Canada (Driver's License, Passport)
- [ ] United Kingdom (Driver's License, Passport)
- [ ] European Union (ID Cards, Passports)
- [ ] Australia (Driver's License, Passport)

## Technical Requirements

### Development Environment
- C++17 compatible compiler (GCC 7+, Clang 5+, MSVC 2017+)
- CMake 3.15+
- OpenCV 4.5+
- Tesseract 5.0+
